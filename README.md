# PathfindingProject
This was for the final project of Data Structures and Algorithms at UF
Video of the Program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqYDcndc2c&ab_channel=FunnyPantsYT
Maze generation info is in the maze_generation folder and with this library in python: https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset
Visuals were done using SFML: https://www.sfml-dev.org/

Algorithms tested were Breadth First Search, Dijkstra's, A*, and Greedy Best First Search
Changing fps in the program changes the speed at which visualization happens, in order to see and observe it easier. To see it at maximum speed, set it to unlimited during testing
